These directories contain various scripts for processing and analyzing limvar ensemble data. 
The intended order of operations is as follows:

1. limvar_zinterp.py
    Interpolates limvar atmospheric variables to pure pressure levels for TEM analysis, writes
    out as a set of new files.

2. limvar_TEM.py
    Performs TEM analysis given the data produced from step 1.

3. limvar_zonalmeans.py
    Performs zonal averaging of the vertically interpolated limvar data from step 1

4. limvar_timeConcat.py
    Processes the data produced in step 3 by concatanating in time

5. limvar_monthly_seasonal_means.py
    computes monthly and seasonal means of the zonally-averaged data

6. limvar_latband_means.py
    computes data means over latitude bands

7. limvar_latband_10daily.py
    computes 10-day averages of the latitude band data from step 6

8. limvar_TEM_budget_monthly.py
    comptues TEM budget quantities on the monthly averaged data

9. limvar_TEM_budget_latbands.py
    comptues TEM budget quantities on the latitude band-averaged data from step 6

10. limvar_TEM_budget_latbands_10daily.py
    comptues TEM budget quantities on the 10-daily latitude band-averaged data from step 7
