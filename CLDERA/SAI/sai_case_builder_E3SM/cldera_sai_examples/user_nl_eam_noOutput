! Namelist settings for HSW++ SAI runs. See namelist setting descriptions inline below.
! By default, this outputs 3 history files with different averaging and frequency (see below).
!
! Namelist definitions and default values are stored at
! components/eam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
! components/eam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_eam.xml
!
! To see all namelist values after case creation, see
! {case_output_root}/run/atm_in
! This file is a concatenation of this contents of the present file (user_nl_eam), and
! all other defaults
!
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


! ------ Output frequencies etc
empty_htapes     = .TRUE.          ! output only the varibales listed below
avgflag_pertape  = 'A','I','A'     ! hist file 1 is avg, 2 is instant, 3 is avg
!NHTFRQ           = -6,-6,-48       ! output frequency every 6 hours, 6 hours, 2 days
NHTFRQ           = -999999,-999999,-999999       ! suppress output
MFILT            = 360,360,360     ! allow 360 time samples per hist file (90 days at 6 hourly outputs)
NDENS            = 2,2             ! single-precision for each hist file
!inithist         = 'ENDOFRUN'      ! output initial conditions at end of run
inithist         = 'NONE'      ! suppress output


! ------ Timestep 
! set the dynamics timestep with se_tstep. The physics timestep MUST be divisible by this number
! (the physics timestep is set via ATM_NCPL at case creation; see the case creation script)
! Also, when setting the dynamics timestep directly in this way, the "old" (CAM) method of timestep
! splitting must be disabled via se_nsplit=-1, rsplit=-1, qsplit=-1. This should be default behavior, 
! depending on the ATM grid selected. Can double check these values in 'atm_in' in the case directory 
! (see note at header of this file). 
! Defaults for ne16pg2_ne16pg2 are se_tstep=600s, ATM_NCPL=48 ==> dtime=1800s, or 1/2 hour physics
! timesteps, 10 minute dynamics timesteps. See more here:
! https://acme-climate.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/1044644202/EAM+s+HOMME+dycore
!
! se_tstep = 600    ! dynamics timestep in seconds (currently unused; remove ! to enable)


! ------ Output fields currently present:
! U: zonal wind in m/s
! V: meridional wind in m/s
! T: temperature in K
! OMEGA: vertical pressure velocity in Pa/s
! PS: surface pressure in Pa
! Z3: geopotential height in km
! SO2: SO2 mixing-ratio in kg/kg
! SULFATE: Sulfate mixing-ratio in kg/kg
! ASH: Ash mixing-ratio in kg/kg
!
! ------ Other optional fields that can be added:
! SAI_HEAT: Local tracer heating rate in K/day
! SAI_COOL: Surface heating by tracer AOD in K/day
! AIR_MASS: Mass of air in grid cells in kg (multiply through mixing ratios to get tracer masses)

fincl1           = 'U','V','T','OMEGA','PS','Z3','SO2','ASH','SULFATE'
fincl2           = 'U','V','T','OMEGA','PS','Z3','SO2','ASH','SULFATE'
fincl3           = 'U','V','T','OMEGA','PS','Z3','SO2','ASH','SULFATE'


! ------ Point to initial condition; currently 5-year HSW spinup
NCDATA="/project/projectdirs/m4014/data/HSW/initial_conditions/netcdf/E3SM_ne16_L72_FIDEAL_10year_spinup.eam.i.0005-01-01-00000.nc.newCoordNames"

ideal_phys_analytic_ic = .false.              ! don't let analytic ICs overwrite input from NCDATA
ideal_phys_option = 'held-suarez-williamson'  ! select HSW idealized forcing
pertlim = 0                                   ! turn off random T perturbations


! ------ Injection namelist settings
! set cldera_sai_stratHeating and cldera_sai_surfCooling both to .false. for passive tracers
! other SAI namelist settings (e.g. lat,lon position, total mass normalization, etc...)
! are not set here, and will assume their default values; see note at header of this file
cldera_sai_read_from_ic_file = .false. ! activate built-in analytic init of cldera sai tracers
cldera_sai_formSulfate = .true.        ! toggle sulfate formation
cldera_sai_stratHeating = .true.       ! toggle local heating
cldera_sai_surfCooling = .true.        ! toggle surface cooling


! These settings are tuned against aspun-up HSW climatology to give zonal-mean monthly-mean 
! heating rates at month 3 post-injection which qualitatively agree with Stenchikov(1998) and 
! Ramachandran(2000). These factors appear in the denominators of the heating terms, so lowering their 
! values will strengthen the heating/cooling responses
cldera_sai_qstar = 9.5e-7              ! dimensionless local heating normalization (kg/kg)
cldera_sai_taustar = 1e7               ! dimensionless AOD surface cooling normalization

! Perhaps a more intuitive way to control the magnitude of the heating/cooling responses is to leave
! the normalization constants (above) as they are, and instead adjust the following temperature
! tendency constants. In either case, results may not be predictable, since the local heating 
! encourages local circulation pertubations, which changes the aerosol mixing ratios. Small changes 
! may be straightforward, but in general this tuning process is an iterative one.
cldera_sai_dTstrat = 0.35              ! Local temperature rate of change by sulfur species 
                                       ! (SO2 + sulfate if cldera_sai_formSulfate is true), in K/day. 
                                       ! This temperature tendency will be met where 
                                       ! (q_SO2 + q_sulfate) = cldera_sai_qstar
cldera_sai_dTsurf = -0.012             ! Local temperature rate of change by the net AOD species 
                                       ! (from SO2, ash, and sulfate if cldera_sai_formSulfate is 
                                       ! true), in K/day. This temperature tendency will be met where 
                                       ! the AOD = cldera_sai_taustar
